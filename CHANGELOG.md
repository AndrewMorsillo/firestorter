# Firestorter

Use Firestore in React with zero effort, using MobX ðŸ¤˜

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.2] - 2018-09-12
### Added
- Added logging of `onSnapshot` errors
### Fixed
- Fixed exception when fetching a Document which doesnâ€™t exist and which has a schema defined

## [0.15.1] - 2018-09-05
### Added
- Added log-message when Document snapshot failed
### Fixed
- Fixed schema validation error not using the `debugName` when specified to constructor

## [0.15.0] - 2018-08-31
### Added
- Added support for code-debugging and smaller bundles on react-native (`react-native` entry in package.json)
- Added support for specifying a specific firebase-app to use, instead of always using the default firebase app (`initFirestorter({firebase, app})`)

## [0.14.2] - 2018-07-12
### Fixed
- Fixed Document not triggering a reaction after calling `Document.update` with a field-path
### Added
- Added debug statement to log `Document` snapshot updates

## [0.14.1] - 2018-07-11
### Fixed
- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when using a dotted FieldPath.
- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when deleting fields using FieldValue.delete().

## [0.14.0] - 2018-06-17
### Added
- Added `Collection.minimizeUpdates` option to prevent multiple updates when starting real-time updates on a Collection. This happens when some of the query results are loally cached, causing Firestore to fire multiple `onSnapshot` events. Enabling this option causes Firestorter to skip/debounce the first local snapshot, in favor of the full result received slightly later from the cloud.
### Fixed
- Fixed unneccessary re-start of real-time updates on `Collection` when the query changes.

## [0.12.1] - 2018-06-11
### Changed
- Replaced `fetching` with the `isLoading` property (better name + isLoading also causes realtime updates to become active, fixes #18)
- Renamed `active` prop to `isActive` (active still supported but shows deprecation warning)
### Fixed
- Fixed `Collection.add` still writing to firestore when schema didn't validate
### Removed
- Removed obsolete firestore snapshot fields `Document.createTime`, `Document.updateTime` and `Document.readTime`

### Fixed
- Fixed `Document.update` throwing exception when schema was used.


## [0.11.0] - 2018-05-30
### Added
- Added new method for defining queries using an observed function (e.g. `col.query = (ref) => ref.orderBy('text', 'asc')`). This is now the new recommended way for defining queries.
